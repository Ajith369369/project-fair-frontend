# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# vercel.json
The `vercel.json` file is a configuration file used by Vercel, a popular hosting platform, to customize the behavior of your deployed application. The specific configuration you've shared defines a rewrite rule, which is a way to route requests to specific files in your application.

The `vercel.json` rewrite rule ensures that all requests to your application are routed to `index.html`, enabling client-side routing in a Single Page Application (SPA). This prevents 404 errors when users navigate directly to different routes and ensures the correct handling of URLs by your frontend code.

### Breakdown of the Configuration

```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```

#### 1. **`"rewrites"`:**
   - The `rewrites` property in `vercel.json` is an array of objects. Each object defines a rewrite rule that tells Vercel how to handle requests to certain URLs.

#### 2. **`"source": "/(.*)"`:**
   - The `source` property specifies the URL pattern to match incoming requests. 
   - `"/(.*)"` is a regular expression pattern that matches any URL path. 
     - `"/"` matches the root URL.
     - `"(.*)"` is a capturing group that matches any character (`.`) zero or more times (`*`), effectively capturing the entire path after the root.
   - In essence, this pattern will match any route, whether it's `/about`, `/contact`, or any other path.

#### 3. **`"destination": "/index.html"`:**
   - The `destination` property specifies the file that the matched requests should be routed to.
   - In this case, all matched requests are directed to `/index.html`.

### What Does This Configuration Do?

- **Single Page Application (SPA) Routing:**
  - This configuration is often used in Single Page Applications (SPAs), like those built with React, Vue, or Angular.
  - SPAs typically use client-side routing, where the JavaScript code on the client side handles different routes (e.g., `/about`, `/contact`).
  - However, when a user navigates directly to a route like `/about` by typing it in the browser or refreshing the page, the server receives the request and needs to know how to handle it.
  - Without this rewrite rule, the server would look for a file named `/about` on the server, which usually doesn't exist in SPAs, leading to a 404 error.

- **How It Works:**
  - This rule ensures that every request, no matter the path, is routed to `/index.html`.
  - Once `/index.html` is loaded, the SPA's JavaScript code (like React Router) takes over, reads the actual path (e.g., `/about`), and displays the correct content.
